Introduction
The task is broken down into two parts
· Part 1 – Automation
· Part 2 – Functional Manual Testing

Part 1 Automation
-----------------

Using the public API below we will like you to demonstrate your ability to write test automation code in a language of your choice. The scenarios to automate are described in the API section below.

Instructions
1. Ideally, store your code on a public hosting repository like GitHub. You may also send it to us in a format that is easy to build.
2. As stated above, use a language you are comfortable with. The team uses Java, but your choice will not disadvantage you.
3. We will like you to write your tests in Gherkin format, ideally using Cucumber. You can use Cucumber with other frameworks e.g., junit, restAssured etc.
4. The submitted code project should have the following:
        a. Feature files
        b. Step definitions
        c. A runner file
        d. Any other supporting code
5. Please document your assumptions or any external dependencies for running the tests.
6. You may break down the scenarios into as many feature files as you see fit.
7. Return the test to our HR representative 5 working days after you receive it 8. You may ask for clarification at any time by emailing dapo.awoola@bbc.co.uk


The API
-------
https://testapi.io/api/ottplatform/media
The above endpoint shows a list of music tracks and metadata. There are 14 such tracks present in the response.
Each music track contains various data elements like type, id, title_list etc.

Automate the following test scenarios for the given endpoint

Scenario 1:
1. Make a GET request to https://testapi.io/api/ottplatform/media
2. Verify that the HTTP status code of the response is 200
3. Verify that the response time of the request is below 1000 milliseconds

Scenario 2:
1. Make a GET request to https://testapi.io/api/ottplatform/media
2. Verify if the “id” field is never null or empty(“”) for all 14 items present in the data array
3. Verify that the “segment_type” field for every track is always “music”

Scenario 3:
1. Make a GET request to https://testapi.io/api/ottplatform/media
2. Verify that the “primary” field in “title_list” is never null or empty(“”) for any track

Scenario 4:
1. Make a GET request to https://testapi.io/api/ottplatform/media
2. Verify that only one track in the list has “now_playing” field in “offset” as true

Scenario 5:
1. Make a GET request to https://testapi.io/api/ottplatform/media
2. In the response headers, verify the “Date” value


Part 2 – Functional Manual Testing
----------------------------------

Please write three test cases (non-automated) for the endpoint above using Gherkin.
Take a good look at the data in the API and come up with three test cases.
You can write them in Gherkin format if you wish.
